<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I am a motivated and ambitious Computer Science student, born in Hyderabad, India, and raised in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, where I spent the last 18 years of my life. Currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in Bahrain, I aspire to become a Cybersecurity Analyst, a field that deeply interests me due to its strategic and ever-evolving nature. I enjoy the challenge of staying one step ahead of potential threats and believe that cybersecurity is not just about defense, but also about critical thinking, foresight, and smart decision-making — much like a game of chess.

Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently maintained a strong academic record by focusing on learning rather than just chasing grades. I bring a calm and focused mindset to my work, inspired by role models like M.S. Dhoni, whose leadership and composure I deeply admire. I enjoy exploring topics related to technology, problem-solving, and digital safety, and I’m always excited to meet new people, gain new experiences, and expand my knowledge through collaboration and real-world exposure. My goal is to use my skills and passion to build a meaningful career in cybersecurity and make my family proud through hard work, continuous growth, and perseverance.</p>
