<h1>Personal Statement</h1>
<p>I’ve always considered Computer Science as a game of chess ever since I first glanced at my textbook in the eighth grade. I still distinctly remember how a specific chapter on Python exposed me to the numerous possibilities to construct and develop a single program – quite like the ebbs and flows of making a precise move to topple your opponent in chess. As I read more topics in the coming years, it would suffice to say that I found myself fascinated with the world of computers and algorithms, enough to want to make it my ultimate career choice.
This goal was the driving force behind my strong academic performance throughout my schooling. I’ve been able to secure the Gold Honour Rolls in almost every grade, further reaffirming in my mind that I’m headed in the right direction. Along with my academics, I was also presented with wonderful opportunities by my school to showcase my leadership abilities. Out of these, the noteworthy ones include being elected the prefect and representing my school in a distinguished exhibition event. Further, attempting several talent search examinations from time-to-time helped me hone my programming skills and acquire a good knowledge of Python. 
When I was routinely exploring the many chapters of my textbook, I stumbled upon a field of Computer Science that instantly caught my fancy – Cyber Security. It reminded me of the crime-based television shows I used to watch with my sisters as a kid and how I would always be fascinated with how the crimes were solved using unique aspects of technology. This hit me like a Eureka moment as I realized I could use my love for technology to genuinely fight crimes and ensure my fellow citizens are more aware of the adverse impact of cyber-fraud. A challenging field like this would test my problem-solving abilities to their fullest, while also keeping me grounded and privy to the larger common good.
Besides academics, I’ve also gotten the chance to explore a variety of other interests, especially Sport. In my free time, I like to look at the different statistics of my favourite games – Football, Cricket, and Formula 1, and get a better understanding of their history. Obviously, I have a lot of favourite athletes but the one who tops the list and who I idolize the most is M.S Dhoni. His calm demeanour in the face of pressure, coupled with his humble beginnings and straightforward outlook on life, never fail to amaze me. Despite achieving soaring heights, he has remained the person he was in the early stages of his journey, something I wish to emulate as I begin my career.
Sport has also helped me come out of my rather introverted nature into to transform into a more jovial and outspoken personality, always ready to have discussions with my friends, be it sports or other day-to-day happenings.
With the foundational aspects of my academics in place with my schooling, I now wish to  become a competent Computer Science Engineer.With top-of-the line resources and facilities provided by the college always at my disposal, I wish to solidify my skill set as a programmer and become an asset to the multitude of global cyber-security firms present today. </p>
